## Selected Academic Projects
### Occupancy-Based HVAC Control (CS 3720 Advanced IOT)
[Details](https://github.com/debarun101/CS-3720-Advanced-Topics-in-IOT/blob/main/Final_Report.pdf)

Developed occupancy detection (using OpenCV, OpenFace) and counting system (majority vote and cluster-based algorithms) by using local image processing in a resource-constrained hardware device (Raspberry Pi). Deployed strategies to control a HVAC system, based on occupant count and occupant activity in a room (in Python). Achieved a 16.85% increase in thermal comfort and a 2.35% increase in energy savings by using a variable cooling rate of the HVAC system that depends on occupant count and activity, when compared to the change in temperature by a fixed cooling rate.



### Multi-threaded Routing Protocol (CS 2520 Wide Area Networks)
[Details](https://github.com/debarun101/CS2520/blob/main/Project_Report.PDF)

Built a multi-threaded system to implement Link State Routing Protocol (using C++), which allows an autonomous system of routers to inter-communicate by using a common protocol. Achieved consistent, successful file transfer in a robust autonomous routing system. Conducted statistical analysis to identify the trend in change of Mean Transfer Time of files with the change in file size and TCP packet size.
