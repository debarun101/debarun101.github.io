## Research Experience
**Doctoral Researcher @ University of Pittsburgh (_Sep 2016 – Present_)**
- Designed and developed a hybrid infrastructure that achieves scalability and coverage for near real-time enforcement of spectrum access.
- Developed an agent-based simulation system that helps achieve efficient assessment of the performance of mobile crowdsourced spectrum monitoring agents in terms of coverage and accuracy of spectrum misuse detection.
- Developed a system that utilizes strategies to achieve effective deployment and selection of crowdsourced spectrum monitoring agents based on their hardware capabilities, availability, and trustworthiness.
- Deployed a composite approach to achieve efficacy in enforcement by exploiting the advantages of vanilla, online threshold-based algorithms and algorithms that ensure stable matching. \
- Achieved an increase in coverage of enforcement region by 19.2% by using the composite algorithm when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.
- Developed efficient strategies of spectrum sampling and reputation management of crowdsourced spectrum monitoring agents to achieve consistency and robustness in the enforcement of dynamic spectrum access.
- Developed schemes that utilize Deep Learning-based methods to improve on crowdsourced spectrum monitoring agent selection.
- Collaborated and coordinated with faculty and fellow graduate students across departments.

### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
